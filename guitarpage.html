                <span id="gibson">Gibson's Historic Reissue ES-335 is back and better than ever — thanks to a year of
                    studying, scanning and listening to original examples. The expert craftspeople at Gibson Custom Shop
                    have rendered every contour, profile, inlay and colour of the priceless vintage models in
                    magnificent detail, and the result is a playing and ownership experience that will keep you coming
                    back for more!

                    The 1961 Reissue models utilise rounded cutaways, SlimTaper neck profiles scanned from the
                    originals, dot inlays and vintage-replica parts. The Murphy Lab 'Ultra Light Aged' finish treatment,
                    paired with lightly aged hardware, simulates decades of subtle playing wear — giving it the unique
                    character, vibe and feel of an original example from Gibson's "Golden Era".</span>
                <span id="fender">Unique, sleek and exclusive – the Vintera Road Worn Mischief Maker Strat is the result
                    of another incredible Muso and Fender collaboration.

                    A few years back, the Fender Custom Shop made a small run of incredible Mischief Maker guitars. We
                    simply had to get in on the action. The Mischief Maker is a unique design consisting of a '60s Strat
                    body and '50s Tele neck, bringing together the best of both worlds. And we've upgraded the pickups
                    to US-made Pure Vintage 59s!

                    The original Mischief Maker was a relic'd guitar so we opted to make it Road Worn. And of course, it
                    had to be finished in Danish Pete's favourite metallic purple colour.</span>
                <span id="jackson">The Jackson Rhoads model was first commissioned by the legendary Randy Rhoads,
                    then-guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne. Its first inception was the Concorde, which had a larger
                    asymmetrical V shape body. Since then, it has been streamlined and sharpened to the point of super
                    metal aggressiveness!

                    The Concept Series Rhoads RR24 HS continues to evolve the metal legacy pioneered by Randy Rhoads,
                    with a refined offset and angular design infused with aggressive tone and effortless playability.
                    Featuring an Alder body and neck-through body construction, the RR24 HS is ergonomic and comfortable
                    with incredible access to the upper frets. The three piece Maple neck is reinforced with Carbon
                    Fibre rods, enhancing its stability and protecting it against shifts in temperature and humidity.
                    The ultra-fast 12”-16” compound radius Ebony fingerboard is a shredder's dream! Chords and riffs
                    near the nut feel effortless, while string bends higher up the neck are smooth and sleek without
                    fretting out.</span>
